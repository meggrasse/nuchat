# Javascript SDK Change Log

## 0.9.0 Public Beta Launch

#### Public API Changes

* layer.Client.createConversation now defaults to creating Distinct Conversations.


## 0.1.4

#### Public API Changes

* layer.Client
  * Now has an `online` event for reporting on whether it is or is not connected to the server.
  * Now clears all queries and reloads their data from the server if disconnected more than 30 hours

## 0.1.3

#### Public API Changes

* layer.Message
  * Now has an `isSending` property
  * Removes the `isLoaded` method
  * Adds the `isLoading` property
* layer.Conversation
  * Removes the `isLoaded` method
  * Adds the `isLoading` property
* layer.Client
  * Now supports a logLevel property with enhanced logging support
  * Adds `messages:notify` event which can be used to help drive desktop notifications more reliably than the `messages:add` event.

#### Fixes

* Fixes to error handling in websocket requests that timeout

## 0.1.2

#### Public API Changes

* layer.MessagePart
   * Now has a `hasContent` property
   * `loadContent()` method has been renamed to fetchContent
   * `fetchContent` now triggers a messages:change event on completion.
   * `content` property has been removed; this is now a private property
   * layer.MessagePart now has a `url` property; returns "" if url has expired.
   * `url` will be set asynchronously by calling `fetchContent()`
     This url will be to a resource cached in the browser.
   * `url` will be set asynchronously by calling `layer.MessagePart.fetchStream()`.
      This url will point to a remote resource, but this is an expiring URL.
   * The expiring url will be cleared when it has expired, requiring another
   call to fetchStream():
```
   function render(part) {}
    if (part.url) {
      return "<img src='{part.url}' />";
    } else {
      part.fetchStream(() => this.rerender());
      return "<img src='' />";
    }
  }
```
* layer.Client now provides a layer.Client.getMessagePart(id) method

#### Fixes

* Fixes to read receipts; no longer sends read receipt if already marked as read
* Fixes to Websocket reconnect logic insures that missed events are requested

## 0.1.1

#### Public API Changes

* `authenticated-expired` event has been replaced with `deauthenticated` event.
* layer.Query and layer.QueryBuilder now support a `sortBy` property which allows for sorting by `lastMessage.sentAt` or `createdAt`.
* Removes option to use XHR instead of websocket for sending messages and conversations
* `message.sendReceipt('read')` now sets the `isRead` property.
* Websocket PATCH events will load the object from the server if it isn't already cached; patch events are not emitted locally but the conversations:add/messages:add event will trigger showing the current state of the newly loaded object.
* Message.sentBy will now always have a value, even if the message is not yet sent.
* Message.isSending property has been added
* Fixes to layer.Query enable Message Queries to populate with the Conversation's lastMessage while waiting for the rest of the messages to load.
* Fixes to layer.Query now ignore any response but the most recent response (occurs when quickly changing between query predicates)


## 0.1.0

#### Public API Changes

* `client.getObject()` is now a protected method; use `client.getConversation()` or `client.getMessage()` instead
* `client.getConversation(id)` no longer loads the Conversation from the server if its not cached; `client.getConversation(id, true)` WILL load the Conversation from the server if its not cached.
* `client.getMessage(id)` no longer loads the Message from the server if its not cached; `client.getMessage(id, true)` WILL load the Message from the server if its not cached.
